### 1. Be a cliche

Print `Hello World!`.

### 2. Create your first function

Create a function that prints a greeting of your choice and execute it.

### 3. Print a greeting for any name.

Create a function that can take a first name as input and print a greeting that includes the name within it.

Here are some examples:

| Name | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `'Alice'` | `'Good morning, Alice!'` |
| `'Bob'` | `'Good morning, Bob!'` |
| `'John'` | `'Good morning, John!'` |



### 4. Create a function to check whether every _letter_ in a string is lowercase.

Your function should return a boolean value.

Examples:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `'hello world'` | `True` |
| `'99 hello world'` | `True` |
| `'Hello world'` | `False` |

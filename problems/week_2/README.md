### Add zeros to a string (Difficulty 3 out of 10)

Create a function that takes in both a string and an integer, and adds the appropriate number of `'0'`'s to the string.

Examples:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `'some_string', 3` | `'000some_string` |
| `'some_string', 1` | `0some_string` |
| `'some_string', 5` | `00000some_string` |

### Find the average (Difficulty 3 out of 10)

Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the average expressed _as an integer_.

### Sort names (Difficulty 5 out of 10)

Create a function that takes two parameters: a list of names and how you want them sorted.  The second parameter can be either `'length'` or `'alphabetic'`.  This second parameter should determine how the list is sorted.  If something other than `'length'` or `'alphabetic'` is passed as the second parameter, your function should raise a `ValueError` with a custom message.

### Find a subnet ID (Difficulty 7 out of 10)

Create a function that, given an IP address and subnet mask (in dotted decimal notation), can determine the subnet ID the IP address belongs to.

### Generate powers of 2

Create a function that takes in an integer N, and returns a list of the powers of two, up to 2<sup>N</sup>.

Examples:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `5` | `[2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32]` |
| `12` | `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096]` |
| `13` | `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192]` |

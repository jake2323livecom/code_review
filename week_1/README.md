### Twofer

Given a lowercase name, print a string with the message:

`One for name, one for me.`

Here are some examples:

| Name | Output |
| --- | --- |
| alice | One for Alice, one for me. |
| bob | One for Bob, one for me. |
| john | One for John, one for me. |

### Print whether or not a string contains only letters

Examples:

| Name | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 'Michael' | True |
| '1234' | False |
| 'Micha31' | False |

### Create a function to check whether every _letter_ in a string is lowercase.

Your function should return a boolean value.

Examples:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `'hello world'` | `True` |
| `'99 hello world'` | `True` |
| `'Hello world'` | `False` |
